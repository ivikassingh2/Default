credit card default prediction dataset provides insights into how financial institutions leverage payment history and demographic information to detect potential fraud and default risk
Context Home loans contribute significantly to retail bank profits, but fraudulent applications—through identity theft, falsified documents, or financial misrepresentation—pose serious risks. Traditional manual verification methods are error-prone, while heuristic-based automation lacks adaptability. Machine learning offers a more effective fraud detection approach, ensuring accuracy and fairness without inheriting human biases.

Problem Statement A bank’s credit department aims to enhance fraud detection in home loan approvals using machine learning. The model must be statistically sound, unbiased, and interpretable to justify flagged applications while adhering to regulatory guidelines.

Objective Develop a classification model to identify fraudulent loan applications and recommend key features for banks to monitor, reducing financial risk while ensuring fair and efficient loan approvals.
